Real-Time Face Detection using YOLOv3
Overview
This project implements a real-time face detection system using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model. The system is specifically trained to detect the face of Elon Musk in various image and video inputs.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Fast and efficient face detection capable of processing live video streams.
Custom Training: The YOLOv3 model is fine-tuned specifically to detect Elon Musk's face with high accuracy.
Scalability: The model can be extended to detect multiple faces or different objects by re-training with additional datasets.
Customizable: The system can be adjusted for different detection thresholds and other parameters as needed.
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
OpenCV
PyTorch
CUDA Toolkit (for GPU support)
